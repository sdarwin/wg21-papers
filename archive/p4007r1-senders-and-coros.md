## Abstract

`std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>) has open issues identified by national ballot comments, LWG issues, and published papers. This paper classifies each issue by whether it can be resolved after C++26 ships or whether shipping forecloses the fix.

---

## Revision History

### R1: March 2026 (pre-Croydon)

* Complete rewrite as an informational classification of open issues.

### R0: February 2026 (pre-Croydon mailing)

* Original analysis of structural gaps. See [P4007R0](https://wg21.link/p4007r0)<sup>[2]</sup>.

## 1. Disclosure

The authors developed [P4007R0](https://wg21.link/p4007r0)<sup>[2]</sup> ("Senders and Coroutines"). The classification below holds regardless of whether any alternative design exists.

## 2. Fixed After Ship

`task`'s `promise_type` is a class template instantiated in user code. Its `operator new`, allocator selection, stop token storage, environment forwarding, and destruction ordering can change between standard revisions without binary incompatibility. These issues are fixable post-ship: [Unusual Allocator Customisation](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Flexible Allocator Position](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Shadowing The Environment Allocator](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Stop Source Always Created](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Stop Token Default Constructible](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Task Not Actually Lazily Started](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Frame Destroyed Too Late](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [No Default Arguments](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`unhandled_stopped` Not `noexcept`](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Environment Design Inefficient](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Non-Sender Awaitables Unsupported](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Future Language Feature Could Avoid `co_yield`](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [No TLS Capture/Restore Hook](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`return_value`/`return_void` Have No Specification](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`co_return { args... }` Unsupported](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`change_coroutine_scheduler` Requires Assignable Scheduler](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Sender-Unaware Coroutines Cannot `co_await` a `task`](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Missing Rvalue Qualification](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Parameter Lifetime Is Surprising](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [No Protection Against Dangling References](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [`co_yield with_error` Is Clunky](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [`co_await schedule(sch)` Is an Expensive No-Op](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [Coroutine Cancellation Is Ad-Hoc](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[4]</sup>.

`affine_on` semantics, rescheduling behavior, and algorithm customisation are specification-level concerns. Tightening requirements or adding default implementations does not change any published interface. These issues are fixable post-ship: [`affine_on` Default Implementation Lacks Specification](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`affine_on` Semantics Not Clear](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`affine_on` Shape May Not Be Correct](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`affine_on` Shouldn't Forward Stop Requests](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`affine_on` Customisation For Other Senders](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Starting a `task` Reschedules Unconditionally](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [Resuming After a `task` Reschedules Unnecessarily](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`bulk` vs. `task_scheduler`](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [No Completion Scheduler](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>, [`with_awaitable_senders` Unused](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[3]</sup>.

## 3. Not Fixable Post-Ship

The issues in this section are items where shipping forecloses the fix.

- **Allocator Timing.** `task` does not allow the user to specify an allocator at the launch site for coroutine frame allocation. The coroutine frame is allocated by `operator new` at the call site, before any sender `connect`/`start` machinery runs. The receiver's environment - which carries the allocator - is not yet available at that point. The `allocator_arg` mechanism in [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup> works around this by requiring the allocator in the coroutine's parameter list, but that locks in a caller-specified approach and forecloses environment-based injection.

- **Allocator Propagation.** `task` does not propagate the frame allocator to child tasks. Each child task allocates its frame independently. Shipping without propagation locks in a design where every launch site must specify its allocator explicitly, foreclosing transparent propagation through the coroutine call tree.

- **Error Return.** `task` requires `co_yield with_error(e)` to propagate an error to the caller. `co_return` cannot carry an error value because `return_value` and `return_void` are mutually exclusive in the current coroutine specification. Shipping this interface locks in the `co_yield` mechanism and forecloses `co_return`-based error propagation, which would require a language change.

- **Symmetric Transfer.** The completion functions (`set_value`, `set_error`, `set_stopped`) and `start()` return `void`, providing no channel to propagate a `coroutine_handle<>`. When a sender completes synchronously, the receiver calls `handle.resume()` on the caller's stack, adding a frame per completion with no upper bound. Shipping this protocol forecloses the `coroutine_handle<>`-returning completion protocol that would enable symmetric transfer.
