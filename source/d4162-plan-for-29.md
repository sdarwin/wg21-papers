## Abstract

Twenty-nine implementers said the committee is adding features
faster than they can ship them. This plan listens.

- **Priority 1:** The Network Endeavor
  ([P4100R0](https://wg21.link/p4100r0)<sup>[1]</sup>) -
  the one major new library for C++29
- **Priority 2:** std::execution maturation - give C++26's
  most ambitious library room to grow
- **Priority 3:** Everything else waits
- **Process:** Feature freeze in August 2028. The final year
  is for polish, wording, and defect resolution
- **Profiles:** Carved out from the language freeze. The
  Direction Group's call to action
  ([P3970R0](https://wg21.link/p3970r0)<sup>[21]</sup>)
  applies; EWG polishes the design while implementations
  materialize

The committee may receive more than one plan for C++29.
That is healthy. This plan is grounded on
[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>, on
twenty years of missing networking, and on working code.

### R0: March 2026 (pre-Croydon mailing)

- Initial publication.

## 1. Disclosure

The author maintains the libraries that implement the Network
Endeavor and has a stake in the outcome. The committee should
calibrate accordingly.

C++20 shipped coroutines in 2020. We built a complete
coroutine-native networking stack: timers, sockets, DNS, TLS,
HTTP. Two libraries, three independent adopters, production
trading infrastructure. We also built I/O on senders, because
the committee deserved a direct comparison
([P4007R0](https://wg21.link/p4007r0)<sup>[3]</sup>,
[P4014R0](https://wg21.link/p4014r0)<sup>[4]</sup>,
[P4088R0](https://wg21.link/p4088r0)<sup>[5]</sup>).

Getting std::execution
([P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[6]</sup>)
into C++26 was a genuine achievement. The exploration of
byte-oriented I/O over coroutines fell to a different team.
Both bodies of work now exist.

Most references in this paper are the author's own. The
author's team produced the published evidence.

Networking is on this plan because the committee asked for it.
[P2000R4](https://wg21.link/p2000r4)<sup>[7]</sup>
listed networking as a priority.
[P0592R2](https://wg21.link/p0592r2)<sup>[8]</sup>,
[R3](https://wg21.link/p0592r3)<sup>[8]</sup>, and
[R4](https://wg21.link/p0592r4)<sup>[8]</sup>
listed networking as must-work-on-first for C++23.
[P0592R5](https://wg21.link/p0592r5)<sup>[8]</sup>
dropped it only because "no composable proposal
exists."<sup>[8]</sup> A composable proposal now exists.

## 2. The train keeps running

C++ ships on time. C++11 shipped late. Every standard since
has shipped on schedule. C++29 will ship on schedule. But
shipping on time means shipping something that works - not a
specification that implementers cannot deliver.

## 3. The implementers spoke

At Kona 2025, twenty-nine compiler and library implementers
wrote
[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>,
"Implementation reality of WG21 standardization":

> Full conformance to recent standards remains difficult in
> practice, with some implementations still working toward
> C++20 conformance.<sup>[2]</sup>

> When features accumulate faster than they can be fully
> implemented, integrated, and adjusted, they stack on top of
> incomplete or inconsistent foundations.<sup>[2]</sup>

They asked the committee to "consider ways of slowing down
the addition of features" and to "consider alternating
feature-focused and consolidation-focused
releases."<sup>[2]</sup>

Stroustrup, in
[P1962R0](https://wg21.link/p1962r0)<sup>[9]</sup>:
"We are trying to do too much too fast. We can do much or do
less fast. We cannot do both and maintain quality and
coherence."<sup>[9]</sup>

Voutilainen, in
[P3265R3](https://wg21.link/p3265r3)<sup>[10]</sup>:
"The motivation is to ship something that works, and is
tested to work. If we have to slow things down to achieve
that, so be it."<sup>[10]</sup>

The Direction Group, in
[P2000R4](https://wg21.link/p2000r4)<sup>[7]</sup>:
"It is not our aim to destabilize the language with a demand
of constant change."<sup>[7]</sup>

**When features stack on incomplete foundations, the standard
becomes a specification that implementers cannot deliver.**

## 4. What this plan is for

A focus plan and a consolidation plan. It responds to
[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>
by limiting new work to one library and devoting the remaining
bandwidth to letting C++26's major features mature.

This is not
[P2000](https://wg21.link/p2000r4)<sup>[7]</sup>.
That paper covers the broad landscape. This paper decides what
the committee works on first - and what it does not work on
yet.

This plan proposes a feature freeze date.

## 5. Priority order

Under this plan:

1. **Networking
   ([P4100R0](https://wg21.link/p4100r0)<sup>[1]</sup>)
   and std::execution maturation.** The only two items that
   receive priority scheduling in LEWG and LWG. Networking is
   the one new library. std::execution gets room to grow:
   integration papers, follow-on work, field-driven
   adjustments from the execution authors and the community
2. **In-pipeline library work.** Papers already under active
   consideration continue to completion. No new papers enter
   the pipeline until the backlog is clear
3. **New library papers.** LEWG considers new papers only when
   its backlog is clear, and only for design review. LEWG does
   not forward new work to LWG unless LWG is similarly idle

**Under this plan, no new language features enter C++29.**

- EWG reviews and polishes language papers when it runs out
  of other work. Under this plan, EWG does not forward new
  language features to CWG
- CWG focuses on defect resolution, wording fixes, and the
  core issues list
- Implementers gain time to finish C++26 before the next wave

The implementers asked for time. This plan gives it to them.

**The pipeline is a queue, not a firehose.**

## 6. The Network Endeavor

C++26 shipped execution, reflection, and contracts. Structured
concurrency, compile-time introspection, language-level
preconditions. Three features pursued for years, delivered.

C++ has been trying to standardize networking since 2005.
[P0592R5](https://wg21.link/p0592r5)<sup>[8]</sup>
dropped it from the C++26 plan because "no composable
proposal exists."

A composable proposal now exists.

[P4100R0](https://wg21.link/p4100r0)<sup>[1]</sup>
describes a thirteen-paper series built on two production
libraries (Capy and Corosio) with three independent adopters
(Boost.MySQL, Boost.Redis, Boost.Postgres) and a production
trading infrastructure company. Published code, not a design
sketch.

The foundation:
[P4003R1](https://wg21.link/p4003r1)<sup>[11]</sup>,
the IoAwaitable protocol. Two concepts, one type-erased
executor, a thread-local frame allocator cache. Six pages.

The bridge:
[P4126R0](https://wg21.link/p4126r0)<sup>[12]</sup>,
"A Universal Continuation Model." Senders invoke any
awaitable without allocating a coroutine frame. One I/O
implementation, both coroutines and senders consume it, zero
allocation for either path. This is the number one
language-adjacent priority for C++29.

Supporting work:
[P4088R0](https://wg21.link/p4088r0)<sup>[5]</sup>,
[P4089R0](https://wg21.link/p4089r0)<sup>[13]</sup>,
[P4092R0](https://wg21.link/p4092r0)<sup>[14]</sup>,
[P4093R0](https://wg21.link/p4093r0)<sup>[15]</sup>,
[P4095R0](https://wg21.link/p4095r0)<sup>[16]</sup>,
[P4096R0](https://wg21.link/p4096r0)<sup>[17]</sup>,
[P4124R0](https://wg21.link/p4124r0)<sup>[18]</sup>,
[P4125R0](https://wg21.link/p4125r0)<sup>[19]</sup>.

Coroutines serve byte-oriented I/O. Senders serve compile-time
work graphs and heterogeneous dispatch. Both serve real
domains. This plan treats them as complementary.

One major new library is the responsible answer to
[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>.
Networking is the one. Twenty years overdue. The substrate is
ready.

## 7. Letting the big features grow

std::execution provides structured concurrency, sender
composition, and a customization point model that enables
heterogeneous dispatch. A specification of this scope does not
reach its full potential in one cycle.

This plan gives std::execution that time. LEWG and LWG gain
bandwidth to process integration issues, performance
discoveries, and follow-on papers from the execution authors
as the feature matures in the field. It is the natural second
phase of a large feature's lifecycle.

The same applies to reflection and contracts. Foundational
additions generate follow-on work. The committee needs
capacity for it.

[P4126R0](https://wg21.link/p4126r0)<sup>[12]</sup>
lives at the boundary between execution and networking:
zero-allocation awaitable consumption from sender pipelines.
As both features grow alongside each other, this bridge
becomes the integration point. A coherent async story, not
two silos.

**The best thing the committee can do for std::execution is
give it room to grow.**

## 8. The freeze

At Croydon, papers were being updated mid-meeting. The last
meeting before a standard ships is not the place for
surprises.

Under this plan, LEWG and EWG stop accepting new papers in
August 2028. The cutoff applies to new proposals, not
revisions of papers already in progress.

The final year - September 2028 through 2029 - is wording
review, defect resolution, integration testing, and polish.
LWG and CWG have the floor. Design groups shift to issue
processing.

[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>
asked for "alternating feature-focused and
consolidation-focused releases."<sup>[2]</sup> A freeze
within the existing three-year cycle achieves the same goal
without changing the cadence.

**The last meeting before a standard ships should contain no
surprises.**

## 9. "One new library - is that enough?"

[P3962R0](https://wg21.link/p3962r0)<sup>[2]</sup>
asked for consolidation. One new library plus room for C++26
features to mature is the consolidation the implementers
requested. The alternative ignores twenty-nine implementers
who said they cannot keep up.

## 10. "Where is std::execution integration with networking?"

Domain separation. Coroutines for byte-oriented I/O, senders
for compile-time work graphs. SG14 published direction in
February 2026 (paper number to be added in R1) advising that
networking not be built on
[P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[6]</sup>.

This plan reserves time for both features to mature.
[P4126R0](https://wg21.link/p4126r0)<sup>[12]</sup>
is the bridge. Both models gain from it.

## 11. "Networking has failed before."

Previous attempts lacked coroutines. Type erasure through
`coroutine_handle<>`, stackless suspension, symmetric
transfer, frame as state - these resolve the structural
problems that stalled prior efforts. Two production
implementations, three independent adopters. Working code.

## 12. "What about safety profiles?"

C++ is under sustained external pressure on memory safety.
Government reports, media campaigns, competing languages.
The committee was designed without executive authority - it
cannot pivot quickly. Profiles are the committee's response
to a real-time threat, and that makes them categorically
different from ordinary language features.

The Direction Group issued a call to action in
[P3970R0](https://wg21.link/p3970r0)<sup>[21]</sup>,
urging implementers to build the Profiles framework and
design initial profiles within it.

Profiles are carved out from the language freeze. Safety
hardening within the existing language - removing undefined
behavior, adding erroneous behavior, library hardening - is
consolidation work and fits in Priority 2 today. Profiles
as a language feature advance to CWG once a credible
implementation ships. Implementations appear to be underway;
the committee is better served by waiting until they
materialize. Until then, EWG polishes the design.

Working code before wording.

## 13. "Study groups?"

They continue. The freeze applies to forwarding, not to
design work. SG1, SG7, SG21, SG22, SG23 all continue. Their
proposals mature during the consolidation cycle and arrive
ready for C++32.

## 14. "Technical Specifications?"

Yes. The freeze applies to the IS working draft. TSes remain
available. This is the escape valve.

## 15. "My favorite idea X?"

This plan reserves bandwidth for one new library and for
C++26's features to mature. Additional work requires
demonstrating that it does not displace that capacity.

## 16. Conclusion

C++29 can be the release that proves the committee listens.
One major new library - networking, twenty years overdue,
built on working code. Room for std::execution, reflection,
and contracts to grow. A freeze that ensures the final year
produces a polished standard. And time - for implementers to
catch up, for the ecosystem to absorb C++26, and for the
committee to deliver quality over quantity.
