## Abstract

Seven coroutine libraries independently converged on a one-parameter task type. Each enforces domain-specific safety invariants through the promise. The only production two-parameter coroutine type - Asio's `awaitable<T, Executor>` - provides a type-erased default; users who opt out for performance immediately hit type incompatibility. `std::execution::task` ([P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>) adds a second template parameter with no default at all. This paper documents why the invariants differ by design and recommends that `std::execution::task` be scoped to the sender domain.

This paper is one of a suite of five. The companion papers are [D4053R0](https://wg21.link/d4053r0)<sup>[12]</sup>, "Sender I/O: A Constructed Comparison"; [D4054R0](https://wg21.link/d4054r0)<sup>[13]</sup>, "Two Error Models"; [D4055R0](https://wg21.link/d4055r0)<sup>[14]</sup>, "Consuming Senders from Coroutine-Native Code"; and [D4056R0](https://wg21.link/d4056r0)<sup>[15]</sup>, "Producing Senders from Coroutine-Native Code."

## 1. Disclosure

The authors developed and maintain [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio)<sup>[3]</sup> and [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy)<sup>[4]</sup> and believe coroutine-native I/O is the correct foundation for networking in C++. The frame allocator gap (Section 3) was identified by Peter Dimov. The cross-library bridges (Section 5) were authored by Klemens Morgenstern. Neither is a co-author. The authors provide information, ask nothing, and serve at the pleasure of the chair.

## 2. Coroutine Types in Production

folly::coro and Boost.Cobalt are in production at scale. cppcoro was deployed at Facebook before folly::coro replaced it. Asio's `awaitable` is included as the only production two-parameter coroutine type.

The interface converged. The machinery diverged. Cobalt embeds intrusive list nodes for cancellation. folly::coro integrates with Facebook's fiber scheduler. Asio's `awaitable` is coupled to `io_context`. Capy propagates `io_env` through `await_suspend(h, io_env const*)`, delivering executor, stop token, and frame allocator at the suspension point.

Asio's `awaitable` provides a type-erased default (`any_io_executor`). Users who replace it with `io_context::executor_type` for performance immediately hit type incompatibility: `await_transform` rejects the mismatch.<sup>[26]</sup>

[P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup> adds a second template parameter: `Environment`. No default. The parameter exists because `task` is both a coroutine return type and a sender. Every function that returns `task` is coupled to the sender environment model.

As of [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>, the wording declares `template<class T, class Environment> class task` with no default for `Environment` ([[execution.syn]](https://eel.is/c++draft/execution.syn)<sup>[16]</sup>, [[task.class]](https://eel.is/c++draft/task.class)<sup>[16]</sup>). The design section states that "any empty type provides the default behaviour" but does not name or standardize such a type. The paper's own examples use `task<int>` with one parameter - ill-formed against its own wording. A future revision may add a default. Even so, the fragmentation argument in Section 2.4 holds: the `Environment` parameter exists so that users provide non-default environments, and the moment they do, the types diverge permanently.

Generic code that accepts `task<T>` does not accept `task<T, MyEnvironment>`. The moment any library in the dependency chain provides a non-default `Environment`, every function in the chain must agree on the type:

```cpp
void spawn_work(std::execution::task<void> work);

std::execution::task<void, net_env> do_network();

spawn_work(do_network());  // does not compile:
                           // task<void, net_env> is not task<void>
```

Both are "the standard task." They do not compile together. No shipped code outside the reference implementation uses a non-default `Environment`. The parameter solves a problem that seven independent libraries solved without it.

**One-parameter task types compose by construction. Two-parameter task types fragment by default.**

### 2.1 The Allocator Ceremony

[P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup> Section 4.6 shows how to enable allocator awareness. The user must define a custom environment struct and use it in every function signature:

```cpp
struct alloc_env {
    using allocator_type =
        std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::byte>;
};

std::execution::task<std::string, alloc_env>
read_body(tcp_socket& sock);

std::execution::task<json, alloc_env>
parse(std::string_view body);

std::execution::task<void, alloc_env>
write_response(tcp_socket& sock, std::string_view body);
```

Every production library:

```cpp
task<std::string> read_body(tcp_socket& sock);
task<json>        parse(std::string_view body);
task<void>        write_response(tcp_socket& sock,
                                 std::string_view body);
```

No standard allocator-aware environment type is provided. Two users who independently define semantically identical structs produce incompatible task types.

### 2.2 Two Empty Structs

Two libraries define empty environments. Identical behavior. Incompatible types:

```cpp
// Library A
struct env_a {};
std::execution::task<int, env_a> compute();

// Library B
struct env_b {};
std::execution::task<int, env_b> fetch();

// Both environments are empty. Both produce identical
// default behavior. The types are incompatible.
```

The standard task type fragments on contact with itself.

### 2.3 Library Upgrade Breaks Downstream

A library that upgrades from the default environment to a custom one changes the return type and breaks every downstream caller:

```cpp
// v1.0: default environment
std::execution::task<response> http_get(url_view);

// v2.0: needs allocator awareness
std::execution::task<response, http_env> http_get(url_view);

// Every downstream caller has a type mismatch.
```

Networking can use thread-local propagation for frame allocators. GPU can use device memory APIs. HFT can enforce zero allocation at compile time. Solutions exist when the promise serves its domain.

### 2.4 Adding a Default Does Not Prevent Fragmentation

A default delays fragmentation; it does not prevent it. The `Environment` parameter exists so that users provide non-default environments. The moment they do, fragmentation begins - and it is viral: every function in the call chain must agree on the type.

Asio demonstrates the mild case. Asio's second parameter is an executor - a narrow concept with a fixed interface (`execute(f)`). Type erasure works: `any_io_executor` wraps any executor behind virtual dispatch. The default covers most users. Even so, users who replace `any_io_executor` with `io_context::executor_type` for performance immediately hit type incompatibility: `await_transform` rejects the mismatch<sup>[26]</sup>, cross-context `co_await` fails at the type level<sup>[27]</sup>, and custom awaitables cannot compose with Asio's `awaitable` without matching the executor type<sup>[28]</sup>. The friction is documented across multiple StackOverflow questions. This is the mild case because the escape hatch exists - users can always fall back to `any_io_executor` at the cost of one virtual dispatch per operation.

[P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>'s `Environment` is the severe case. The environment is not a narrow concept with a fixed interface. It is an open query-response protocol: `get_stop_token`, `get_scheduler`, `get_allocator`, and any user-defined query, each with a different return type. The set of queries is unbounded. A type-erased `any_environment` would require `std::any`-style dynamic dispatch for every query, each with a different return type. This is technically possible. It destroys the compile-time composition that is the sender model's entire value proposition - completion signatures become runtime-dependent, `then` and `let_value` cannot deduce return types, and the zero-overhead property that justifies the model's complexity is gone. An `any_environment` that preserves the sender model's compile-time properties does not exist and cannot exist, because the query set is open-ended. The fragmentation is not a performance trade-off with an escape hatch. It is a choice between fragmentation and abandoning the properties that make the sender model worth having.

**The diversity in the table above is not fragmentation. It is fitness.**

## 3. Why the Invariants Differ

Every production library extends the C++20 awaitable protocol with domain-specific safety invariants. [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>'s `await_transform` + `affine_on` maintains executor continuity and stop token propagation for recognized senders within `std::execution` ([P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[9]</sup>). Four gaps remain. Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 are engineering gaps with papers in progress - they may be closed in future revisions. Section 3.3 is architectural: the sender model's deferred delivery and the networking model's immediate delivery are contradictory requirements that no single task type can satisfy.

### 3.1 Frame Allocator

`affine_on` returns the coroutine to the correct scheduler thread. The thread-local frame allocator on that thread is whatever the previous coroutine left - not the allocator for this chain. No hook exists between `affine_on` completing and the coroutine body resuming where TLS can be restored. Peter Dimov identified this gap. [P3980R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2026/p3980r0.html)<sup>[6]</sup> addresses allocator sourcing but does not restore TLS on resumption.

### 3.2 Foreign Awaitables

[P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>'s `await_transform` recognizes senders. A non-sender awaitable - `cppcoro::task<int>`, a Cobalt awaitable, any C++20 awaitable - passes through without `affine_on`, without stop token wiring, without environment propagation. All three invariants are lost. Networking libraries reject non-conforming awaitables at compile time. [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup> permits them. Non-sender domains require their own task types.

### 3.3 Timing

Senders deliver context through `connect`/`start` after the coroutine frame is allocated. Networking delivers context at `co_await` time through `await_suspend`. The frame allocator must be available before the child's `operator new` ([[dcl.fct.def.coroutine]](https://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.fct.def.coroutine)<sup>[16]</sup>) - before any sender machinery runs. No mechanism in `std::execution` ([P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[9]</sup>) delivers an allocator to `operator new` without `allocator_arg_t`. Deferred delivery serves senders. Immediate delivery serves networking. The requirements are incompatible.

### 3.4 Symmetric Transfer

The sender-awaitable's `await_suspend` returns `void`, foreclosing symmetric transfer. Jonathan M&uuml;ller confirmed in [P3801R0](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[7]</sup>: *"a thorough fix is non-trivial and requires support for guaranteed tail calls."* Dietmar K&uuml;hl documented the gap in [P3796R1](https://wg21.link/p3796r1)<sup>[8]</sup>.

---

## 4. The `IoAwaitable` Protocol

`IoAwaitable` is not proposed for standardization. It is the authors' design and is presented here as one example of what domain-specific compile-time enforcement looks like - not as the only possible design. The cross-domain bridges in Section 5, authored independently by Klemens Morgenstern, provide the stronger evidence that domain-specific protocols are the norm. [P4003R0](https://wg21.link/p4003r0)<sup>[2]</sup> defines the concept:

```cpp
template<typename A>
concept IoAwaitable =
    requires(A a, std::coroutine_handle<> h,
             io_env const* env)
    {
        a.await_suspend(h, env);
    };
```

The `io_env` pointer carries three fields:

```cpp
struct io_env
{
    executor_ref executor;
    std::stop_token stop_token;
    std::pmr::memory_resource* frame_allocator;
};
```

These are the three invariants Section 3 identifies as gaps in [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>. `IoAwaitable` delivers all three at `await_suspend` time. Every awaitable in the chain receives the environment. No deferred delivery. No timing gap.

### 4.1 Closed by Design

The promise's `await_transform` passes `io_env*` to `await_suspend(h, env)`. Any awaitable that does not accept the second parameter fails to compile. The check applies to all awaitables - coroutine-backed or not. A foreign awaitable with the standard `await_suspend(coroutine_handle<>)` signature does not compile. The invariant violation is a type error, not a silent runtime degradation.

### 4.2 Contrast with `task`

[P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>'s `await_transform` calls `as_awaitable(expr, promise)`. For recognized senders, this wraps them in an awaiter that applies `affine_on` and stop token propagation. For non-sender awaitables, the expression passes through unchanged - no `affine_on`, no stop token, no environment propagation. The `Environment` template parameter controls what the promise advertises through `get_env()`, but the awaitable never sees it unless it is a sender that goes through `connect`/`start`.

| Property                                    | `IoAwaitable`                      | P3552R3 `task`                    |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Foreign awaitable `co_await`ed              | Compile error                      | Compiles, invariants lost         |
| Non-coroutine awaitable gets environment    | Yes (`io_env*` in `await_suspend`) | No (only senders via `connect`)   |
| Enforcement point                           | `co_await` site (compile time)     | `connect`/`start` (runtime path)  |
| Invariant violation mode                    | Type error                         | Silent                            |

`IoAwaitable` demonstrates that the `await_suspend` signature is the natural enforcement point, and it works for all awaitables, not just coroutine-backed ones. [P3552R3](https://wg21.link/p3552r3)<sup>[1]</sup>'s permissive model is appropriate for the sender domain. It cannot serve as a general-purpose correctness boundary because it has no mechanism to reject non-conforming awaitables.

---

## 5. Cross-Domain Bridges

The [cross_await](https://github.com/klemens-morgenstern/cross_await)<sup>[17]</sup> repository (Klemens Morgenstern) contains four cross-library composition examples. All four require explicit adaptor code.

| Outer library | Inner library | Adaptor file          | Lines |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|------:|
| Cobalt        | Capy          | `cobalt_capy.cpp`     |    67 |
| TMC           | Capy          | `tmc_capy.cpp`        |    51 |
| Capy          | Cobalt        | `corosio_cobalt.cpp`  |   105 |
| Capy          | TMC           | `corosio_tmc.cpp`     |    60 |

From `cobalt_capy.cpp`:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct capy_task_adaptor {
    capy::task<T> tt;
    capy::io_env env;
    std::stop_source src;
    boost::asio::cancellation_slot slt;

    template<typename Promise>
    auto await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<Promise> h) {
        auto& p = h.promise();
        env.executor        = p.get_executor();
        env.stop_token      = src.get_token();
        env.frame_allocator = p.get_allocator().resource();
        slt = p.get_cancellation_slot();
        slt.assign([this](auto ct) {
            if ((ct & boost::asio::cancellation_type::terminal) !=
                      boost::asio::cancellation_type::none)
                src.request_stop();
        });
        return tt.await_suspend(h, &env);
    }
};
```

The bridge knows both protocols. It is specific to the pair. There is no generic bridge because the invariants are domain-specific.

### 5.1 Sender Bridges

[D4055R0](https://wg21.link/d4055r0)<sup>[14]</sup>: consuming senders from `IoAwaitable` code. One class template. Satisfies `IoAwaitable`, propagates stop token, dispatches back to the originating executor. `set_error(std::error_code)` becomes `io_result<T>` - no exceptions. Does not use `std::execution::task`.

[D4056R0](https://wg21.link/d4056r0)<sup>[15]</sup>: producing senders from `IoAwaitable` code. Compound I/O results are rejected at compile time. The coroutine body inspects the compound result, reduces it to `error_code`, and the bridge routes it through three channels without exceptions.

### 5.2 The Bridge Pattern

All six bridges share three properties:

- **Opt-in.** No bridge is automatic.
- **Explicit.** The bridge code is visible. No silent invariant translation.
- **Responsibility.** The bridge author maintains invariants across the boundary.

Cross-domain composition works. The C++20 awaitable protocol is the surface all bridges bottom out to.

---

## 6. No One True Task

Gor Nishanov stated the design intent in [P1362R0](https://wg21.link/p1362r0)<sup>[10]</sup> (Section 3.7):

> "The separation is based on the observation that coroutine types and awaitables could be developed independently of each other by different library vendors. In a product, one could use N coroutine types that describe how coroutine behaves and M awaitables describing how a particular asynchronous API should be consumed. Users can freely mix and match coroutines and awaitables as needed."

And at CppNow 2017<sup>[11]</sup>: "We did not want to tie it to a particular task library. [...] We wanted them to be open."

`promise_type` is the extension point. Unifying all task types into one forces either carrying every domain's invariants (bloat) or carrying none (unsafe). [D4053R0](https://wg21.link/d4053r0)<sup>[12]</sup> and [D4054R0](https://wg21.link/d4054r0)<sup>[13]</sup> document a concrete example: I/O returns `(error_code, size_t)`, and the three-channel model forces a routing decision that loses the byte count, the channel semantics, or both.
